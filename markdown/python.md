# Introduction

The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface. Tkinter was written by Fredrik Lundh.

# Basic Terms
## Window
This term has different meanings in different contexts, but in general it refers to a rectangular
area somewhere on the user's display screen.

## Top Level Window
A window that exists independently on the screen. It will be decorated with the standard frame
and controls for the desktop manager. It can be moved around the desktop, and can usually be resized.

## Widget
The generic term for any of the building blocks that make up an application in a graphical user interface.

## Frame
In Tkinter, the Frame widget is the basic unit of organization for complex layouts. A frame is a
rectangular area that can contain other widgets.

# First GUI Application
Creating a GUI application using Tkinder is not that difficult if you are already familiarized with Python.
